One of the things I enjoy the most about coding is discovering patterns. Being aware and mindful of the patterns emerging in your codebase can make it easier to keep that codebase consistent, readable and easy to navigate. Most patterns will remain unspoken, and some, that prove notably elegant, are named and promoted as best practices. Others might even be candidates for a basis of a new abstraction, although I recommend restraint as it's worth remembering that [abstractions are expensive](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions).
